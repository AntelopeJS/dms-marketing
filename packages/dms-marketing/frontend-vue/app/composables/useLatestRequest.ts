/**
 * A read whose answers may land out of order, resolved so that only the
 * newest one is ever shown.
 *
 * Every surface of this module refetches on a selection, a period and
 * sometimes a search box, and those fetches are not ordered: a slow answer for
 * the site, page or funnel the user just left would otherwise repaint over the
 * one on screen. The rule is the same everywhere — stamp each run, and let a
 * run write only while it is still the latest — which is exactly what this
 * owns instead of leaving it to be re-derived per component.
 *
 * `fetcher` returns `null` when there is nothing to ask for (no selection yet,
 * or server-side, where there is no session to authenticate with). That is a
 * settled empty state, not a failure and not a load: it clears the data and
 * leaves nothing spinning.
